## **Application Architecture**

### **MVC Structure:**
- **Models**: Eloquent models with relationships and business logic
  - User model with avatar handling
  - TrackingHistory with comprehensive relationships
  - FilterByUser trait for data isolation
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests, business logic, and responses
  - DashboardController with complex financial calculations
  - RESTful controllers for CRUD operations
- **Views**: Blade templates with component-based architecture
  - Layout components (layout.blade.php, login-register-layout.blade.php)
  - Modular view structure with AJAX sections
- **Routes**: RESTful routing with middleware protection

### **Key Design Patterns:**
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Trait Usage**: Code reusability (FilterByUser, HttpResponses)
- **Middleware**: Authentication, setup verification, request filtering
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable Blade components

### **Security Features:**
- CSRF protection
- User-based data isolation through FilterByUser trait
- Authentication middleware
- Input validation and sanitization

## **User Interface & Experience**

### **Layout Structure:**
- **Top Navigation**: User profile with avatar, logout functionality

## **Data Flow & Business Logic**

### **Transaction Processing:**
1. User initiates transaction (income/expense/transfer/loan)
2. Transaction recorded in `tracking_history` with date/time
3. Account balances updated in `arhead` table with row_sign logic
4. Real-time dashboard updates via AJAX
5. Monthly/yearly aggregations calculated dynamically

### **Balance Calculation Logic:**
- Uses `arhead` table with row_sign for debit/credit logic
- Supports excluded accounts for separate tracking
- Transaction charges factored into balance calculations
- Current balance = SUM(amount * row_sign) - SUM(transaction_charge)

### **Dashboard Analytics:**
- Month-wise grouping of transactions for current year
- Year-wise grouping for historical data
- Real-time chart data generation for line charts
- Pie chart data for wallet/income/expense status

## **Routing Structure**

### **Authentication Routes:**
- Registration, login, password reset
- Guest middleware protection

### **Main Application Routes:**
- Dashboard with chart data endpoints
- Wallet management (CRUD + status charts)
- Income source management
- Expense type management with sub-categories
- Budget planning by month/year
- Transaction processing
- Tracking and reporting
- Dreams/goals management

### **AJAX Endpoints:**
- Section reloaders for dynamic updates
- Chart data endpoints
- Real-time balance updates

## **File Structure Analysis**

### **Key Directories:**

- `app/Models/` - Eloquent models with relationships
- `app/Traits/` - Reusable code components
- `database/migrations/` - Database schema definitions
- `resources/views/` - Blade templates and components
